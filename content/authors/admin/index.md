I graduated from Dartmouth College in Winter of 2020 and will begin my PhD studies in Neuroscience at Yale University Department of Psychology in Fall of 2020. Broadly, I like studying the computational principles that underlie our idiosyncratic experiences of the world. I also enjoy running, baking pies at 2am, and searching for dogs to pet.
