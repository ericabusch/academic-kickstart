To understand how animals process incoming information, neuroscientists must study their behavior patterns. Deep learning algorithms promise to enhance behavior quantification. Such algorithms have been successfully applied to vertebrate behavior partly because their movements are segmented by fixed joints and constrained by rigid skeletons. Contrastingly, octopuses move with seemingly infinite degrees of freedom, and their arms are segmented with visually homogeneous suckers, which makes automated behavior tracking challenging. Each sucker is highly innervated and packed with chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, amassing vast amounts of information. This data informs how the arm coordinates exploration and foraging despite limited neural connections to other arms and the brain. To investigate how octopuses accomplish complex behaviors within this distributed neural system, we trained a deep learning model to track sucker movement as the octopus used a single arm to forage. We demonstrated that deep neural networks can model sucker behavior despite their visual similarity and largely unconstrained movement patterns. Our model opens the door for automated analyses of the behavior of the octopus arm neural system, including how suckers recruit one another and other arms to accomplish tasks without communication through the brain. This work could inform the development of “smart” prosthetics since one problem facing brain-machine interfaces with prosthetics is that implants cannot reliably detect and decode the massive signals sent from the human brain to biological limbs to execute smooth, goal-driven behavior. Octopus arms coordinate movement from their brain’s relatively low-bandwidth signal, perhaps because of their highly-interconnected sensorimotor loop within individual arms. In the future, octopus arms could be a biological inspiration for semi-autonomous prosthetics that can smoothly execute goals via local-connection-heavy sensorimotor loops.
