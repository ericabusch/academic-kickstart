Currently, I am working on developing a new method of functionally aligning subjects' BOLD responses to take advantage of the different information shared in time-locked stimuli responses and functional connectivity patterns. This paper is in preparation. 

Past projects in the Haxby Lab have involved using fMRI, hyperalignment, and multivariate pattern analysis to locate brain regions and pathways responsible for construction and interpretation of narratives. I presented this research at the 2019 Wetterhahn Science Symposium and am preparing a manuscript for publication.

My research with the Haxby Lab has been funded since January of 2018 by the Sophomore Scholars Program, the James O. Freedman Presidential Scholars Program, the Neukom Scholars Program, and the David C Hodgson Endowment for Undergraduate Resarch Award.
