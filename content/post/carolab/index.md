I completed my undergraduate honors thesis in cognitive science with the Robertson Lab at Dartmouth College. This project, "A Deep Learning Approach to Understanding Real-World Scene Perception in Autism". This project investigated patterns of spatial attention allocation within 360-degree, virtual-reality scenes across participants with autism, controls, and computer vision models (CNNs). My thesis was awarded high honors, a Neukom Institute Prize for Outstanding Undergraduate Research, and the Academic Achievement Prize for Cognitive Science.

[Abstract](/post/neukom/)

I also co-developed a software package for using convolutional neural networks to process omnidirectional images and comparing those activity maps to human gaze behavior in 360-degree space. This is a methods paper in preparation and was presented at the Virtual Vision Sciences Society Annual Meeting 2020.
