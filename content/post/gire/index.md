I joined the [Laboratory of Comparative Systems Neuroscience](http://girelab.com/) as an NSF REU Fellow through the University of Washington's Center for Neurotechnology during Summer 2019 to study octopus cognition, specifically decision-making during foraging tasks. I built a deep learning model for tracking the motion of individual octopus arms and individual suckers on the arm to infer the local computations occurring within the armâ€™s neural system. See below for videos of my model in action.

While at the CNT, I had the pleasure to be involved in a [number](http://centerforneurotech.org/feature-stories/reu-supports-undergraduate-student-research-mentorship-and-growth) of [outreach programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uecqQUUi54w&t=42s), including the [Women's Career Mentoring program](http://centerforneurotech.org/feature-stories/breaking-glass-ceiling-women%E2%80%99s-career-mentoring-lunch-facilitates-conversation-about).

[See here](/post/octos/) for an abstract of the talk and poster I presented on this project at the Center for Neurotechnology Research Symposium.
